## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript for Interactive Elements

### What I learned

This was a fun challenge that put my frontend skills to the test.

This was a good project to work on my responsive web design skills and I was able to practice both css Grid and flexbox.

I have been enjoying using the BEM method for organising my style sheets.

The mobile animations + javascript for the navbar and testimonial sections, were fairly straightforward but it took me a while to find a desktop animation for the testimonials that I was happy with.

### Continued development

I would need to spend more time working on animation.

I would also want to spend more time with BEM as I ran into a problem where It was annoying to overwrite my global styles. I will be sure to follow BEM more closely in future projects.

Also while it is not as big an issue on small hobby projects I would like to clean up my javascript code.
